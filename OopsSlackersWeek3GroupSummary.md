## Project Goal - 

Team Oops Slackers is working towards building a service that uses netbooting with iPXE for remote imaging solutions
and network operations. We will be working in a closed environment using raspberry pi to take on the role of 
a DHCP and TFTP server. Our end goal is remotely booting and deploying windows 7 to any computers in the classroom
not booting properly.

## Tasks and Progress - 

Some great progress was made this week on multiple fronts.

iPXE progress had a breakthrough which can be viewed [here.](https://github.com/paveldanek/Week-14-and-Oops/blob/master/Summary3.md)
HTTPS certificate documentation is located [here.](https://github.com/rarar0/TFTPslackersOops/blob/master/DocumentationHTTPS.md)
DHCP and TFTP documentation [here.](https://github.com/rarar0/TFTPslackersOops/blob/master/DocumentationTFTP.md)
DHCP local deployment trials documented [here.](https://github.com/luschool/oopsslackersluschool/blob/master/OopsSlackersWeek3Individual.md)

### Goals for the coming week -  

Now that we have most of the groundwork laid out its time to put the pieces together. 
Intergrating our iPXE progress with our DHCP/TFTP/HTTP progress will be a big goal of ours this week.
Our other focus will be on the windows side of things. We need to obtain an image as well as 
figuring out all the steps to deploying WinPE with wimboot.
